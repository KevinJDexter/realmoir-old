This is a practice run of a site designed to manage and maintain the characters, locations, and more related
to whatever story is being written. The final product will ideally allow for a user to keep track of all
details for their story, as well as how they interact with one another, and allow a user to dynamically
swap between information based on what is clicked.

TO-DO: 
[X, ] Create foundation for Characters (Multiple steps. Should iron this out a bit more)
[ ] Create a webpage that will display Character information
[ ] Load character page with correct information based on argument passed
